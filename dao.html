                    A Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO) is unlike any hierarchical controled structure from a
                    traditional organisation.
                    Centralised exchanges are an example of this; you might want a token listed, but besides banding the
                    community together and carrying out a Twitter barrage, you have very
                    little influence on that decision coming to fruition.<br /><br />
                    DAOs place the community participants in control of the platform transparently and programmatically.
                    The power of contracts enforced by mathematics means
                    that a large number of automated actions within a contract can be set up and voted on, the results
                    of which will be automatically actioned.
                    This would mean the community would be able to propose and vote on which tokens they want to be
                    listed. On a successful vote,
                    these tokens would be automatically listed. Resistant to external entities, governments and bad
                    actors getting in the way of that decision.<br /><br />

            <h2 id="spartanDao" class="mb-4"><img src="./assets/Pictograms/SVG/picto_reward.svg" />Spartan DAO</h2>
            <p>The community should already be familiar with the Spartan Protocol ethos being; "birthed by the community for
                the community" with the initial developers building the platform the way they wanted to see
                it within the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Chosen for its power, speed and low fees.<br />
                Having Spartan Protocol run by a DAO was a central pillar of its development. The intent is to release
                the DAO in stages to familiarise the community with these powerful decentralised decision-making
                features.<br /><br />
                Spartan Protocol's DAO is open source, which means the code can be viewed by anyone. Moreover, all of
                the rules and financial transactions are recorded in the Blockchain.
                This makes the DAO transparent, immutable and most importantly, resistant to corruption.<br /><br />
                It's also worth noting that with DAOv2, there will be a "Grant" feature implemented. This will
                allow the community to send a SPARTA grant to a wallet address. The community may choose to reward the
                active contributors, or maybe even draw some more in by sending a grant to a trusted community member to
                share it out as bounties for fixing things, or to develop something new all together.<br /><br />
                Only LP tokens can be staked in the DaoVault, which is a deliberate decision to ensure maximum liquidity
                is available for token swapping. More liquidity remaining in the pools means lower slippage for token
                swaps,
                which inturn means more incentive for users to utilise the Spartan Pools. <br /><br /> </p>

            <h4 class="mb-3">Use your LP Tokens in the DAO</h4>
            <li>Stake them in the DAO to gain voting rights with governing the protocol</li>
            <li>Staking in DAO also enables you to earn extra SPARTA through 'Harvesting' in 'Lock+Earn'</li>
            <br /><br />
            <p>By staking in the DAO, not only will you be eligible to harvest SPARTA in ‘Lock+Earn’, but you will also
                have the usual slip fees + dividends go directly into the liquidity pools which your LP tokens can be
                redeemed for.
                <br /><br />
                In order to incentivise community participation in the DAO, 10% of the SPARTA emissions will be directed
                into the DAO contract as well as any proposal fees. You will in real-time accrue SPARTA that can be
                harvested.

            <h2 id="daoWeight" class="mb-4"><img src="./assets/Pictograms/SVG/picto_blockchain.svg" />DAO Weight</h2>
            <p>The community continues to drive Spartan Protocol and if you want to join the DAO, it is hoped that you
                join it with the intent to
                see it succeed, grow and prosper for the LONG TERM. We should focus on proposals that will benefit the
                platform
                in the long run, that means focusing on things that help it grow, develop and improve reach before
                focusing on
                individual benefit. Community value will drive results in individual benefit, it most likely won't work
                the other way around.</p><br />
            <h4 class="mb-4">Get involved and influence the direction of Spartan Protocol</h4>
            <p>To have your say with proposing assets you must be providing weight in the DAO. To do this you must:</p>
            <li>Provide liquidity to the SP pools — When you add liquidity to a pool you will receive LP tokens
                representing your weight in the relative pool.</li>
            <li>Lock LP tokens in the DaoVault — You will then need to visit the "DaoVault" option under "Vault" in the
                navigation menu.</li><br />
            <p>You can either vote on current proposals or put forward your own. Browse the list of current pending
                proposals and vote if you agree with them. Voting in support of a proposal does not attract any fees
                other than
                "gas" which thanks to BSC is insignificant when compared to other chains.</p><br /><br />
            <h4 class="mb-4">Proposals from anyone in the community</h4>
            <p>If you want to submit a new proposal there is a 100 SPARTA fee for it to be listed. This is done to
                discourage spam proposals and ensure the proposal being put forward has been thought about. The fee is
                allocated
                to the DAO contract to be used towards "Grants"<br /><br />
                If a proposal reaches a voting weight greater than 50% of the total DAO weight, it will automatically be
                switched over to "finalising" status by the smart contract, where it will sit for the "CoolOffPeriod"
                (currently set at 3 days). After the "CoolOffPeriod" has passed, anyone can attempt to finalise the
                proposal where it will recalculate and if still above 50% will automatically run the required function/s
                to make
                the proposed action happen.<br /><br />
                In the case below when > 50% of votes are reached, 2.5M SPARTA will be added to the Bond+Mint contract.
                If you want to vote against the proposal all you need to do is….nothing. Well, except ensuring you have
                some
                weight in the DAO that is NOT voted "for" the proposal. By not voting you are voting "no" on the
                proposal. The intent is that proposals will need to be actively communicated within the community
                channels on telegram,
                debated, refined and then collectivity moved forward. The majority of the community will need to support
                the proposal to get it to move forward.

                    project towards a prosperous future. You will need to stake your LP tokens into the DAO using the
                    "DaoVault" feature displayed in the picture.<br /><br />
                    Once you have joined the DAO, you will be able to check your percentage weighting which is located
                    next to your current SPARTA rewards available. The higher the liquidity you provide to the protocol,
                    the more
                    liquidity tokens you will have to be able to lock in the DAO and therefore the more voting power

                    The ‘Propose’ dropdown under the DAO menu bar will allow you to interact with the DAO proposals
